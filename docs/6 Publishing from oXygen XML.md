# Publishing from oXygen XML Editor

**oXygen XML Editor** is a tool designed for authoring, editing and developing XML-based technical documentation. It is available as a standalone application for platforms such as Windows and Mac, as well as an Eclipse plug-in.

Like MadCap Flare, oXygen also supports single-sourcing, allowing you to produce various outputs including PDF, ePUB, HTML, WebHelp etc. using the same source files. It supports a wide range of documentation frameworks such as DITA, DocBook and XHTML. The editor includes the industry-standard **DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT)** and provides real-time validation.

You can create your content using either a text-based interface or a WYSIWYG-based editor, which makes the process accessible to people with limited XML experience. This flexible approach to content input facilitates collaboration across the teams whose members have various levels of XML expertise.
