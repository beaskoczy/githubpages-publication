# Publishing oXygen XML project to GitHub Pages

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

* oXygen XML Editor
* DITA project created in oXygen
* GitHub Account
* GitHub Desktop installed
* empty GitHub repository created for this project

## Prepare Your DITA Project

1. Open your DITA project in oXygen XML Editor.
2. Create a *.ditamap* file for your project if it doesn’t exist yet.
3. Make sure all output files are saved within your local GitHub repository folder.
4. Save your output files in the */docs* subfolder of your repository directory for more efficient file management.

>**Note:**  
>Don’t save your output files directly in the main repository folder!

## Create a Transformation Scenario

1. In the Transformation Scenarios right bottom panel, click the **plus (+)** button.
2. Select **DITA-OT Transformation** from the dropdown.

3. In the dialogue that appears, choose **WebHelp Responsive**.
4. Name your scenario and select a template under the *Templates* tab.
5. Under the Output tab:
    * Choose an output directory within your local GitHub repository (e.g., *yourrepositoryname/docs*) to ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages.
    * Ensure the Temporary files directory is different from the Output directory.

oXygen XML will generate a WebHelp Responsive website in the specified output folder.

## Reviewing and Preparing Your Project for Publishing

1. Open the output folder and confirm that all files were generated successfully.
2. Launch GitHub Desktop.
3. In the **Changes** tab, review the file modifications.
4. Enter a commit summary (e.g., *"Add WebHelp output for publishing"*).
5. Click **Commit to main** (or your current working branch).
6. Click **Push origin** to upload the changes to your GitHub repository.

## Enabling GitHub Pages

1. Open your repository on Github.com.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, select **Pages**.
4. Under **Source**, configure the following settings:
    * Branch: *main* (or your current working branch),
    * Folder: */docs* (or other folder containing your output).
5. Click **Save**.

GitHub will build and publish your documentation automatically. Once the publication process is completed, a link to your live GitHub Pages site will appear on the same page.

6. Visit the link to your GitHub Pages site to view your published oXygen XML content.
