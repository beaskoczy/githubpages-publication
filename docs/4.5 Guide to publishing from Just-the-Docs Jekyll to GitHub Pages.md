* created a GitHub repository with your Markdown files

## Create a New Repository Using the Just-the-Docs Template

1. Go to the [Just-the-Docs template repository](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template).
2. Click **Use this template > Create a new repository**.

3. Name your repository and make sure your repository has public visibility settings. 
4. Click **Create repository from template**.

## Clone Your New Repository

1. On your new repository page, click the **Code** button.
2. In the Clone tab, click **Open with GitHub Desktop**.
3. Confirm the browser pop-up window to open your repository in GitHub Desktop.
4. Choose a local folder to save your project files.
5. Click **Clone**.

## Configure Your Static Site

1. Open your cloned repository in Visual Studio Code.
![Opening cloned repository](../images/3%20Just-the-Docs/img2.png)
2. Edit the *_config.yml* file with your custom settings. You can choose from the configuration options below:  

```
title: Your Documentation Title
description: A brief description of your documentation
theme: just-the-docs # DO NOT DELETE THIS!! THEME IS REQUIRED IN YOUR .CONFIG FILE
baseurl: "/your-repo" # your repository name
url: "https://yourusername.github.io" # your GitHub Pages URL

# Optional customization
logo: "/assets/images/logo.png"
favicon_ico: "/assets/images/favicon.ico"
color_scheme: light # you can also use dark color_scheme

# Enable search
search_enabled: true # use only if you want to enable search function

# Heading reference
heading_anchors: true

# Navigation links
  aux_links:
    "View on GitHub":
        - "//github.com/yourusername/my-documentation"

```

3. Update the *README.md file* to describe your documentation repository.  

> **Note:**  
> Refer to [Just-the-Docs documentation](https://just-the-docs.com/docs/configuration) for additional configuration options.

## Transfer Markdown Files from Your Repositories

1. In VS Code, create a *docs* folder by right-clicking the folder pane and selecting New Folder.
2. Clone the repositories containing your Markdown files and open them in VS Code.
3. Select the files you want to copy from the source repository and right-click **Copy**.
4. Go to the window with your Just-the-Docs repository, select the docs folder and right-click **Paste**.

You can create multiple folders for structure clarity. For images, create the folder named *images* following the tutorial above.

## Add Front Matter to Markdown Files

Front matter is a snippet of YAML containing key metadata. It is included in every Markdown file within a Jekyll project. Front mutter must be added at the top of each file, set between triple-dashed lines.

You need to add front matter to your Markdown files that contain your documentation in order to set up navigation and ordering. To do that:

1. Open each of your Markdown files in VS code.
2. Add front matter **at the top** of each file.

Selected templates for front matter are located below.

### index-md

```
---
title: Home
layout: default
nav_order: 1
---
```

> **Note:**
> index.md is also a top-level page. nav_order for it should always be 1.

### Top-level page

```
---
title: Top-level page
layout: default
nav_order: 2
---
```

> **Note:**  
> When numbering the top-level pages, remember to start your nav_order with 2, as index.md is also a top-level page.

### Parent page with child pages

```
---
title: Parent page
layout: default
nav_order: 3
has_children: true
---
```

### Child page

```
---
layout: default
title: Child page
parent: Parent page
nav_order: 1
---
```

In **title** line, put the title of your child page.
The **parent** line should contain the title of the Parent page.

> **Note:**  
> Child pages can have their own child pages - it is called deep nesting.

## Update the Homepage

Edit the index.md file in the root directory to suit your project needs using Markdown syntax.
