# Output Generating Methods: Pros and Cons

The people responsible for technical documentation are often tasked with selecting the most suitable tools for their projects. This decision is often influenced by factors such as cost, operating systems compatibility, or technical expertise needed to use the tools effectively.

This chapter presents the comparison of three input methods commonly used to generate documentation: **MadCap Flare HTML**, **oXygen XML**, and **Just-the-Docs Jekyll**. While all of them support publishing static sites through GitHub Pages, choosing the right tool depends on the specific needs of your project.

The table below compares MadCap Flare HTML, oXygen XML, and Just-the-Docs Jekyll theme. The comparison includes factors such as cost, authoring interface, input complexity, and knowledge requirements.

| Factor | MadCap Flare | oXygen XML Editor | Just-the-Docs (Jekyll) |
| -------| ------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Cost** | $234–$339/month per user (subscription) | $229–$636 for 6–12 months <br> $942–$1,678 with support and maintenance | Free (open source)                      |
| **Authoring Interface** | Visual and code-based editor (WYSIWYG and XML view) | Visual editor with plain text view | Markdown-based text editor; minimal setup |
| **Input Complexity** | Moderate (requires learning Flare-specific features) | Moderate to high (structured authoring in DITA) | Low (standard Markdown with YAML front matter) |
| **Required Knowledge** | Basic HTML/CSS, XML, and Flare project setup | XML, DITA or DocBook frameworks, CSS for styling | Basic Markdown |
| **Project Fit** | Large-scale documentation, content reuse, multi-channel publishing | Structured content, technical specifications, and strong content reuse | Lightweight sites, changelogs, or simple guides |
| **Platform Compatibility** | Windows only (Mac via virtualization) | Windows, macOS, Linux | Platform-independent |
| **Other Output Formats** | HTML5, PDF, EPUB, and more | HTML, PDF, EPUB, custom formats | Primarily web (can be used to generate a PDF output using plugins) |
