# Introduction to Docs as Code

**Docs as Code** is a philosophy that applies software development practices to the process of creating and managing technical documentation. With this methodology, documentation is:

* Stored in a version control system (e.g., Git);  
* Reviewed and updated collaboratively (e.g. via pull requests);  
* Written in plain text formats (e.g. Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc);  
* Automatically tested.  

This approach is popular because it enables quick updates to the content. It also fosters collaboration between writers, subject matter experts, and other team members through version control features like branching, merging and rollback. It also promotes equal collaboration from all the members of the project. Applying this workflow to your project ensures that the documentation is accurate, up-to-date and tightly integrated with the development lifecycle.
