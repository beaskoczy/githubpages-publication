# Setting up GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a much more user-friendly and accessible alternative to command line. You can install it on Windows, Mac or Linux.

## Installation and Configuration

You need a GitHub account to get started with GitHub Desktop. **Create one [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)** if you haven’t already done so.

The installation process for GitHub Desktop is simple:

1. Install Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Choose the installation file appropriate for your operating system.
1. Download GitHub Desktop from the [official website](https://desktop.github.com/download/). Select the appropriate version for your operating system.
2. Go to your **Downloads** folder and double-click the GitHub Dekstop installation file. 
3. Follow the installation prompts. Once finished, GitHub Desktop will launch automatically.

## Signing in to GitHub Desktop

After installation, connect your GitHub account to the desktop app:

1. When GitHub Desktop launches, click the appropriate Sign in option. This will open a browser window where you will be able to continue the authentication process.

2. In the browser window, enter your credentials and click **Sign in**. If you’ve signed in before, click **Continue** next to your account.
3. Follow the prompts on screen to return to GitHub Desktop.
4. In the **Configure Git** window, select **Use my GitHub account name and email address**. Enter your GitHub login details if they haven’t been pre-filled.
5. Click **Finish**.

Now you can set up your first GitHub repository following the prompts on your screen. Learn more about creating repositories [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop).

> **Note:**
> Your repository must be public when using a free GitHub account with GitHub Pages. Click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility) to learn more about repository's visibility settings.
