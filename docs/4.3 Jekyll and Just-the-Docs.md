# Jekyll and Just-the-Docs 

**Jekyll** is one of the most popular static site generators available online. It was written in Ruby by GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. It takes Markdown and HTML files and creates a static website using customizable templates. 

Jekyll is well-suited for documentation purposes due to:

* built-in support for GitHub Pages;
* simple content creation workflow;
* large collection of templates.

Jekyll is mainly used to host simple pages such as blogs, landing pages and software documentation. In this tutorial, we are going to use Just-the-Docs. It is one of the most popular themes for Jekyll, designed specifically for technical documentation purposes. You can create source files for this template in Markdown, HTML, and Liquid templating language.

Just-the-Docs supports various features such as:

* multiple navigation options;
* automatic table of contents;
* search functionality;
* mobile responsiveness;
* customizable color schemes.
