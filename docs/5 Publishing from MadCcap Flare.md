# Publishing from MadCap Flare

**MadCap Flare** is a professional tool for creating and managing technical documentation. It enables you to publish your docs in multiple formats, such as PDF, HTML5 etc., from a single source which eliminates the need to maintain separate projects for each output format. 

This approach is known as **single-sourcing**. It means that documentation is based on reusing components such as topics, variables, snippets, conditions, graphic files across different outputs. As a result, MadCap Flare is perfect for projects that require strong content reuse and consistency across outputs.

MadCap Flare is using a topic-based approach model and uses XML for content creation. This setup allows for modular content management and efficient reuse across different deliverables.
